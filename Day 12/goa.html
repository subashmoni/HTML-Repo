    <h5>About</h5>
    <p>
      Goa (/ˈɡoʊə/ (listen)) is a state on the southwestern coast of India within the Konkan region, geographically
      separated from the Deccan highlands
      by the Western Ghats.[6][7] It is bound by the Indian states of Maharashtra to the north, and Karnataka to the
      east and south, with the Arabian Sea
      in the west. It is India's smallest state by area and fourth-smallest by population. Goa has the highest GDP per
      capita among all Indian states,[3][8]
      two and a half times as high as the GDP per capita of the country as a whole.[9] The Eleventh Finance Commission
      of India named Goa the best-placed state
      because of its infrastructure, and India's National Commission on Population rated it as having the best quality
      of life in India.
      Panaji is the state's capital, while Vasco da Gama is its largest city. The historic city of Margão in Goa still
      exhibits the cultural influence of the Portuguese,
      who first voyaged to the subcontinent in the early 16th century as merchants, and conquered it soon thereafter,
      whereupon Goa became an overseas territory of the
      Portuguese Empire, part of what was then known as Portuguese India, and remained as such for about 456 years until
      it was annexed by India in 1961.
